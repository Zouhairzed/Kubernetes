LoadBalancer: 
Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer. ( ex: In AWS, it will create an ELB for each service which exposes the type as the “LoadBalancer”. ) Then you can access the service using the dedicated DNS name of the ELB.


NodePort: 
Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port. You can connect to the NodePort service outside the cluster by requesting <NodeIP>:<NodePort>. This is a fixed port to a service and it is in the range of 30000–32767.



ClusterIP: 
ClusterIP service is the default Kubernetes service. Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the service only reachable from within the cluster. But to expose these services to outside you need ingress controller inside your cluster.
